To use the processor, run the testbench.tcl file.
The processor will load the program.txt file containing the program to run, assuming it is located in the same directory.
That will reset the processor and run it for 10,000 cycles with the loaded program with branch prediction enabled.
After running for the desired amount of cycles, it will reset the processor and run the program again with branch prediction disabled.
You can look at the waveforms to view the important signals in the processor pipeline.

After running the program, 3 files will be written to the directory:
1) register_file.txt        Contains the register contents in accending order
2) memory.txt               Contains the memory contents in accending order
2) instructionMemory.txt    Contains the instruction memory contents in accending order

This submission is vastly improved over that for PD4 (a lot of important bug fixes, hazard detection and whatnot is implemented as well).
Most of the code needed for the branch prediction optimization is in stage_if.vhd, with a little in stage_ex.vhd.
