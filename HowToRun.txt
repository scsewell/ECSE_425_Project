To use the processor, run the testbench.tcl file.
The processor will load the program.txt file containing the program to run, assuming it is located in the same directory.

After running the program, 3 files will be written to the directory:
1) register_file.txt        Contains the register contents in accending order
2) memory.txt               Contains the memory contents in accending order
2) instructionMemory.txt    Contains the instruction memory contents in accending order
